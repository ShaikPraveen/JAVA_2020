Access Modifiers
================
  There are Four types of access modifiers in java
    1.public 2.private 3.default and 4. protected

 1.public  : public modifer can be accessed through out(or)anyware of the object, 
             just by creating an object of the class.
 2.private : private members can be accessed within the class only, 
             outside of the class we can access private methods or variables.
      Note : How we can access private variables or methods?
      Ans:   By using "this" keyword
 3.default : If you don't specify any modifier, it will takes as default modifier.
             The scope of default modifier is within the package only.
 4.proteced : protected members can be accessed within the package (or) 
              if you want to access outside of the class(another package) should be the child class,
              then we have to inherit by using extends keyword.
