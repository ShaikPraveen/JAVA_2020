STRING HANDLING IN JAVA
=======================
 String is a special type of a class, we can create a Object for String Class
 
 
 what is difference between == and equals?
 
    -> We are going to use  '==' we will compare variable values,
       Means in integer and float and char we can compare variables
       
    -> In String we don't compare variables, we can compare only String Objects
