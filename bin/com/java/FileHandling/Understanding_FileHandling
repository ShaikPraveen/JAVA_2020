 File Handling in Java
 =====================
  
   Read Data From Text File we will use the Following Classes
    
      ->  Using FileReader
      ->  Using BufferedReader
      
   Write Data To  Text File we will use we will use the Following Classes
   
     -> Using FileWriter
     -> Using BufferedWriter
     
     
     
     What is the Difference b/w FileReader and BufferedReader?
     
      ->In FileReader we can read the Data From Character by Character, It will read data in Integer Format
      ->In BufferedReader we can read the Data From Line By Line,It will read data in String Format
       
    What is the Difference b/w FileWriter and BuffeWriter?
    
    -> In FileWriter the data is Override,
    -> Whenever we will executing the program it will print data in same single line
    -> In FileWriter whenever we will save the data, it's taking one character at a time and saving to the file 
    -> Suppose we have big file, it will takes lot of time to save the file, to overcome this problem we will use BuffredWriter
