In Java we have two types of Exceptions like Compiletime Exceptions and Runtime Exceptions
 
  Compiletile Error:-
  ================
  
    Here we have print statement
        
        system.out.println(); //It will throw an exception. Here actually here 'S' is Capital letter
    
        This errors are also known as Syntatical errors
        
   Runtime Error:-
   ================   
   
        Runtime exceptions are also called as Exceptions
        
      Two types of Exceptions
        1. Checked    Exceptions
        2. UnChecked  Exceptions   
        
        
    Throws Keyword:-
    ==============
    1. Declaration an Exception
    2. Throw an exception to caller of that code
    3. Can throw only checked exceptions
    4. Declare at method level
    5. Need to define exception classes
    6. Can use multiple classes seperated by comma 
    
    Throw Keyword:-
    ==============
    1. To manually throw an Exception
    2. Need to place in body of the method
    3. Need to pass object of Exception class
    4. Only one exception throw at runtime
    
    
     Difference between Throws and Throw?
     
               Throws                                                Throw
       1. Declare An Exception                           1. Manually throw an Exception
       2. In Method Level                                2. Inside the Method Methody
       3. Declare multiple exceptions                    3. Only throw one exception
       4. Exception class name                           4. Pass onject of excetion class
    
    
    Finally Keyword:-
    ===============
     When we will use Finally keyword?
     
         If you are handlig checked exceptions, we don't use Finally 
         If you are handling unchecked exceptions, we will use Finally
