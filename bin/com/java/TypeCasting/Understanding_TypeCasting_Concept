What is Type Casting?

   Type Casting Means:-
    
    I have some data which is stored in one data type variable, 
              i want to take it to the another data type variable
              
     There are two types of Type Casting?
        1. Implicit Type Casting:
             
                  Means Smaller or same size data type value is transferred to Bigger or Same size data type
            
        2. Explicit Type Casting
        
               From bigger data type to smaller data type
