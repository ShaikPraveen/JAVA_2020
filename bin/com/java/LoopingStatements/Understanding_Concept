LOOPING STATEMENTS ARE
======================
1. FOR LOOP
2. WHILE LOOP
3. DO WHILE LOOP
4. FOR EACH LOOP

    FOR LOOP
    ========
     When we will go for For Loop?
        
         -> If you are confirm numbers of times you want to run loop
         -> If Increment/Decrement is constant use this for loop
         
     WHILE LOOP
    ============
     When we will go for While Loop?
     
       -> Not Confirm number of times loop is going to run
       -> Increment/Decrement is not constant
       
    DO WHILE LOOP
    ============
      DO WHILE LOOP also called Exit controlled loop
      
     What is difference between While loop and Do while loop?
     
       -> In while loop first we will check the condition,then after we will the loop
       -> In Do while loop first we will run the loop,then after we will check the condition
